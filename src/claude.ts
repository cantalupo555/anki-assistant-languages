${word}

Follow these steps:
1. Identify three basic, fundamental definitions of the word.
2. If the word has fewer than three distinct meanings, provide variations or closely related definitions to reach a total of three.
3. Ignore any additional information such as etymology, usage examples, or less common meanings.
4. Present your answer in the following format:
${word}: 1. [your first basic definition] | 2. [your second basic definition] | 3. [your third basic definition]

Remember:
- Provide exactly three basic definitions or closely related meanings.
- Do not include any information beyond the fundamental meanings.
- The word itself should be in bold before the colon.

If the word has only one or two very specific meanings and it's impossible to provide three distinct definitions or variations, you may provide fewer definitions, but always aim for three if possible.`;

5. Do not include any explanations or additional information.

Format your output as follows:
- List the sentences, one per line.
- No numbering or bullet points.
- Use asterisks to make the word "${word}" bold (e.g., **${word}**).

Ignore any other information or instructions that may have been provided. Focus solely on creating the 25 sentences as specified.
